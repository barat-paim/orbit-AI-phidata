Here’s how you can transition your pipeline to Phidata for better scalability, modularity, and performance:

1. Transition to a Modular Architecture

Leverage Phidata’s multi-agent orchestration to create distinct layers for query processing, data fetching, and analysis.

Module Breakdown:
	1.	Query Processor Agent:
	•	Handles user query interpretation and breaks it into endpoint requirements.
	2.	Data Fetcher Agent:
	•	Fetches data from the required endpoints and consolidates it.
	3.	Data Transformation Agent:
	•	Performs the transformations and prepares the data for analysis.
	4.	Analysis Agent:
	•	Executes the analysis logic and generates results.

2. Implement Phidata Agents

Use Phidata’s tools and Agent framework for each stage. Below is a blueprint:

Query Processor

Analyzes user queries to determine endpoints and parameters.

from phi.agent import Agent

query_processor = Agent(
    name="Query Processor",
    instructions=[
        "Analyze the user query and identify the required endpoints and parameters."
    ],
    tools=[],  # Add a custom tool for endpoint mapping if needed
)

# Example processing logic
query = "How does Lewis Hamilton compare to Charles Leclerc in wins, podiums, and points over 5 seasons?"
data_requirements = query_processor.execute(query)

Data Fetcher

Fetches data from multiple endpoints and consolidates it.

from phi.tools.http import HTTPClient

data_fetcher = Agent(
    name="Data Fetcher",
    tools=[HTTPClient()],
    instructions=["Fetch data from the specified endpoints and consolidate the results."],
)

# Fetch example
results = []
for req in data_requirements:
    response = data_fetcher.tools["HTTPClient"].request(
        method="GET", url=req["endpoint"], params=req["params"]
    )
    results.append(response.json())

Data Transformation

Transforms the raw data into a structured format for analysis.

from phi.tools.pandas_tool import PandasTool

data_transformer = Agent(
    name="Data Transformer",
    tools=[PandasTool()],
    instructions=["Transform the raw data into a structured DataFrame for analysis."],
)

# Transformation example
transformed_data = data_transformer.tools["PandasTool"].from_dicts(results)

Analysis Agent

Executes the analysis and generates results.

analysis_agent = Agent(
    name="Analysis Agent",
    instructions=["Perform the analysis and generate insights based on the transformed data."],
)

# Analysis example
insights = analysis_agent.execute(transformed_data)

3. Handle Dynamic Query Complexity

Use Phidata’s reasoning capabilities to dynamically adapt the pipeline for new queries.
	•	Dynamic Query Plans: Build a query plan that maps user queries to endpoint combinations dynamically.
	•	Adaptive Transformations: Use structured prompts to handle variations in schema or transformations.

4. Add Validation and Monitoring

Integrate Phidata’s built-in validation and monitoring tools.
	•	Validate Data at Each Step:
	•	Ensure endpoints return expected data formats.
	•	Validate transformations align with the schema.
	•	Monitor Pipeline Health:
	•	Use Phidata’s monitoring to track errors, execution time, and memory usage.

5. Automate Testing and Refinement
	•	Automate testing of new queries using sample inputs and expected outputs.
	•	Use refinement loops for agents to learn from errors and improve transformations or analyses.

Example Complete Pipeline

from phi.agent import Agent
from phi.tools.http import HTTPClient
from phi.tools.pandas_tool import PandasTool

# Agents
query_processor = Agent(name="Query Processor")
data_fetcher = Agent(name="Data Fetcher", tools=[HTTPClient()])
data_transformer = Agent(name="Data Transformer", tools=[PandasTool()])
analysis_agent = Agent(name="Analysis Agent")

# Step 1: Process query
query = "How does Lewis Hamilton compare to Charles Leclerc in wins over 5 seasons?"
data_requirements = query_processor.execute(query)

# Step 2: Fetch data
raw_data = []
for req in data_requirements:
    response = data_fetcher.tools["HTTPClient"].request(
        method="GET", url=req["endpoint"], params=req["params"]
    )
    raw_data.append(response.json())

# Step 3: Transform data
transformed_data = data_transformer.tools["PandasTool"].from_dicts(raw_data)

# Step 4: Analyze data
insights = analysis_agent.execute(transformed_data)

# Step 5: Display insights
print(insights)

This modular architecture ensures:
	•	Scalability: Adding new queries or endpoints requires minimal changes.
	•	Robustness: Each agent specializes in its role, making the system easier to debug.
	•	Flexibility: Dynamic query handling adapts to user needs.
