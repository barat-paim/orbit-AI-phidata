# Edge Case Queries
# These queries test the system's handling of complex scenarios

## Temporal Complexity
1. Compare Verstappen's performance in rainy races vs dry races in the last 5 seasons, but only counting races where he qualified in top 3
2. Calculate the correlation between pit stop times and final race position for Mercedes in races where it rained during qualifying but was dry during the race

## Multi-Entity Analysis
3. Show me races where Ferrari outperformed Red Bull in qualifying but lost the race, focusing on tire strategy differences in 2023
4. Compare Verstappen, Hamilton, and Alonso's performance in the last 3 laps of races where all three finished on podium

## Boundary Conditions
5. Compare lap times between P1 and P20 in Monaco 2023 but only in sectors where yellow flags were shown
6. Find races where a driver started outside top 10 but won the race, then compare their tire strategies with P2 finisher

## Ambiguous References
7. Who performed better in their rookie season - Hamilton or Verstappen?
8. Show me the average gap between teammates in qualifying but only count sessions where track temperature was above 40Â°C and both cars made it to Q3

## Hypothetical Scenarios
9. How would the 2023 championship standings look if we only counted races where all drivers finished?
10. Compare every driver who has ever won a race in wet conditions since F1 began, ranked by win percentage
