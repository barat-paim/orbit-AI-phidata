Product Brief: Query-to-DataFrame AI Engine

Vision

To build a universal AI-powered analytics engine that transforms natural language queries into structured insights—starting with F1 analytics and scaling to other domains.

Core Objective

Develop a multi-agent system capable of:
	1.	Parsing diverse queries to understand data requirements.
	2.	Dynamically generating single dataframes, relational dataframes, and graphs.
	3.	Generalizing across domains with minimal adaptation (e.g., tennis, finance).

Key Features
	1.	Query Parsing: Convert natural language into actionable data requirements.
	2.	Query Processing: Map requirements to endpoints, parameters, and metadata.
	3.	Data Handling: Generate and populate clean, query-relevant dataframes.
	4.	Visualization: Deliver intuitive outputs (tables, charts, graphs).

Success Metrics
	1.	Accuracy: >90% for single dataframes; >80% for relational queries; >75% for graph queries.
	2.	Efficiency: Query-to-output in under 5 seconds.
	3.	Generalization: Demonstrate cross-domain adaptability (F1 → Tennis).

Why F1 First?

Rich, structured datasets and diverse query types provide the perfect testbed to validate system flow and user interaction.

This brief focuses on creating a scalable, investor-ready prototype that highlights generalizability, modularity, and future applications beyond sports analytics.
