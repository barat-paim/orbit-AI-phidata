# Changelog

## Development Progress

1. Identified performance issues in legacy F1 processor, decided to split into specialized components (query understanding, endpoint mapping, data fetching, transformation) for better maintainability and performance.

2. Created `query_to_endpoint.py` with dedicated agents for query understanding and endpoint mapping, solving the problem of inconsistent endpoint selection and reducing unnecessary API calls.

3. Implemented systematic query analysis in Understanding Agent to extract subjects, metrics, and time periods, ensuring consistent parameter extraction across different query types.

4. Added pattern matching and temporal range handling in Endpoint Agent to optimize endpoint selection, reducing the number of API calls needed for time-based queries.

5. Created `data_fetcher.py` with rate limiting and parallel processing, solving Ergast API timeout issues by implementing backoff strategy and concurrent request handling.

6. Enhanced error handling in data fetcher with exponential backoff and batch processing, addressing API rate limits and improving reliability of data collection.

7. Developed `data_transformer.py` as a pure data processing component using pandas, solving the need for flexible data manipulation without LLM dependencies.

8. Implemented modular data transformation pipeline (normalize → clean → derive metrics) to handle different response types consistently.

9. Added derived metrics calculation based on data type, enhancing analysis capabilities by computing win rates, performance deltas, and race statistics.

10. Standardized testing framework across components using query indices, making it easier to reproduce and debug issues with specific query types.

11. Created `data_processor.py` as a base class for data processing, with subclasses for each endpoint type.

12. Added `schemas.py` to define data types and structures for each endpoint, ensuring consistency and type safety across components.

13. Added `transform_logic.py` to handle the transformation logic for each endpoint, ensuring consistency and type safety across components. This only serves as a reference for the transformation logic, and is not used in the actual data processing.

14. Tested the test_endpoints_processor.py to test the data transformation logic, and it passed all the endpoints.

15. Tested the data_fetcher.py to test the pipeline with 34 query, and it failed. The circult query does not select the correct endpoint.


## Next Steps

- Enhance error handling and validation in data transformation
- Add more derived metrics for different analysis types
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Create visualization component for transformed data
