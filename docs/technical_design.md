Technical Design Brief for MVP Using Phidata Framework

This brief outlines the technical implementation of the Query-to-DataFrame AI Engine MVP using a multi-agent orchestration approach. Each component aligns with the product brief and workflow goals, with a focus on modularity and scalability.

Workflow Components

1. Query Processing
	•	Purpose: Parse user input and generate structured data requirements.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Multi-agent model using NLP techniques to identify:
	•	Query type (e.g., trend analysis, comparison).
	•	Entities, metrics, filters, and endpoints.
	•	Utilize spaCy or OpenAI GPT models for intent detection and data mapping.
	•	Input: User query in natural language.
	•	Output: Structured query metadata in JSON format.

2. Data Fetching
	•	Purpose: Retrieve raw data from APIs based on query metadata.
	•	Implementation:
	•	API orchestration agent to dynamically call endpoints with parameters.
	•	Use requests or httpx for handling API interactions.
	•	Cache responses using a lightweight solution like Redis to reduce API load.
	•	Input: Endpoint(s) and parameters from the query processor.
	•	Output: Raw data in JSON format.

              └── Driver
                  ├── givenName
                  └── familyName

3. Data Transformation
	•	Purpose: Clean, process, and aggregate raw data into structured formats.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Use pandas for data manipulation.
	•	Build modular scripts for:
	•	Filtering based on query parameters.
	•	Calculating derived metrics (e.g., win rates, averages).
	•	Add error handling for missing or inconsistent data.
	•	Input: Raw data from API responses.
	•	Output: Structured DataFrame ready for analysis.

4. Analysis
	•	Purpose: Perform analytical computations based on the query type.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Analytical agent to interpret the query type and execute:
	•	Trend analysis (e.g., historical win rates).
	•	Comparative analysis (e.g., constructor vs. constructor).
	•	Return both raw insights and summaries in JSON.
	•	Input: Processed DataFrame and query metadata.
	•	Output: Analytical insights (JSON format).

5. Visualization
	•	Purpose: Generate intuitive visual outputs for user queries.
	•	Implementation:
	•	Visualization agent to convert insights into:
	•	Line charts for trends.
	•	Bar charts for comparisons.
	•	Graphs for networked data (e.g., overtaking relationships).
	•	Use plotly or matplotlib for chart generation.
	•	Optional: Integrate streamlit for interactive user demos.
	•	Input: Analytical insights.
	•	Output: User-facing charts and visualizations.

Workflow Overview

Component	Input	Output
Query Processing	Natural language query	Structured query metadata (JSON)
Data Fetching	Metadata with endpoints and parameters	Raw data (JSON)
Data Transformation	Raw data (JSON)	Processed DataFrame
Analysis	DataFrame and query metadata	Analytical insights (JSON)
Visualization	Analytical insights (JSON)	Charts and visualizations

Key Challenges
	1.	Query Processing:
	•	Handling vague or ambiguous queries.
	•	Ensuring accurate mapping to APIs and parameters.
	2.	Data Fetching:
	•	Managing rate limits and API inconsistencies.
	•	Ensuring data completeness for complex queries.
	3.	Data Transformation:
	•	Handling nested or incomplete data structures.
	•	Adding flexibility for domain-specific metrics.
	4.	Analysis:
	•	Generating insightful summaries for diverse queries.
	•	Managing computational complexity for large datasets.
	5.	Visualization:
	•	Ensuring visual clarity and relevance for investor demos.
	•	Optimizing graph generation for networked data.

Next Steps
	1.	Start with Query Processing:
	•	Build an agent to convert user queries into structured JSON metadata.
	2.	Develop Data Fetching:
	•	Integrate a few F1-specific API endpoints and validate data retrieval.
	3.	Implement Transformation and Analysis:
	•	Focus on trend analysis and relational dataframe handling.
	4.	Add Basic Visualization:
	•	Generate simple line and bar charts for F1 analytics.
